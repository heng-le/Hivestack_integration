# Hivestack_integration
Hello! This is my attempt that developing an integration between Hivestack's platform and a Legacy CMS system. To begin, first download all the necessary modules from 
requirements.txt. Then, follow these instructions:
1. Go to the folder on your terminal
2. Type in the arguments. The units can just be typed in as in (e.g. testa testb), but the number of plays per hour must be added after a -n (e.g. -n 10) for 10 plays. A sample argument would be something like this:
  - C:\Users\User>python assignment1.py testa testb -n 10
3. The script will then output a csv file named output.csv with the relevant information. You can change the name of the file as required. 

Happy integrating!
